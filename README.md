The goal of this demo project is to recreate some of the game engine tools given to the developers as tools for the user. 
The main goal would be to give the player the ability to spawn/delete/place basic shapes (cube, sphere, plane, etc.)
as well as the ability to manipulate those objects (transform, rotate, resize)
Essentially, the idea is to make the player have the ability to make whatever they want in the a VR sandbox space. A god-mode sort of game. 
There are several sandbox games of this kind out there, but not many of which are in VR.
The requirements for this demo project to be completed would be:
A UI/Menu system through which players can access their objects
An array of set objects for the player to manipulate through play. (To make this more game-like, this list could be expanded as time goes on, or as more objects are placed.)
The player should have the ability to manipulate objects using VR controller inputs.
The player should have the ability to create simple effects (Lighting, Time, Clouds(rain, snow, lightning), Fog, etc.)
Optional: The player should have the ability to save and load the "levels" that they have created.
Optional: The world should become active once the player has created it. 
Optional: The player can take "captures" of their world to share with others
Optional: The player can spawn in a "character" which they can possess to explore the world they have created.
